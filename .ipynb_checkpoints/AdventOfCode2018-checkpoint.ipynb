This process is independent of the particular intersection at which the cart has arrived - that is, the cart has no per-intersection memory.\n",

They do this based on their current location: carts on the top row move first (acting from left to right), then carts on the second row move (again from left to right), then carts on the third row, and so on. Once each cart has moved one step, the process repeats; each of these loops is called a tick.\n",
